The goal of this project is to study the Indian Railway Network through the lens of network science by modeling stations and train routes as a directed graph. Each station is treated as a node, and every direct train movement between two stations is a directed edge. The aim is to understand the underlying topology, temporal behavior, and zonal clustering of the railway system using network science principles. Finally, we exhibit the small world property of the Indian Railway network using an interactive interface.
